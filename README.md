This software is still in an early development (alpha) stage and not ready for production use just yet. Please try it out, give feedback, and help fix bugs.

# About

This repo contains several packages to develop and build scalable React.js apps.

* [@shaizei/babel-preset](./packages/@shaizei:babel-preset/README.md) - This package contains shareable babel.js configuration used by the applications created with @shaizei/cli.

* [@shaizei/cli](./packages/@shaizei:cli/README.md) - An unapponionated CLI to build React.js apps without tears.

* [@shaizei/eslint-config](./packages/@shaizei:eslint-config/README.md) - This repository contains shareable ESLint configuration used by the applications created with @shaizei/cli.

* [@shaizei/prettier-config](./packages/@shaizei:prettier-config/README.md) - This repository contains shareable Prettier configuration used by the applications created with @shaizei/cli.

* [@shaizei/scripts](./packages/@shaizei:scripts/README.md) - This package contains automation task used by the applications created with @shaizei/cli.

* [@shaizei/typescript-config](./packages/@shaizei:typescript-config/README.md) - This package contains shareable TypeScript compiler configuration used by the applications created with @shaizei/cli.

* [@shaizei/webpack-config](./packages/@shaizei:webpack-config/README.md) - This package contains shareable webpack configuration used by the applications created with @shaizei/cli.

# Getting Started

## Installation

The first step is to install `@shaizei/cli` to quickly scaffold an application.

Using Yarn:

```shell
yarn global add @shaizei/cli
```

Using npm:

```shell
npm install @shaizei/cli -g
```

## Scaffolding a new App

In order to generate a React-JavaScript app, named as `my-demo-app`, run the following command:

```shell
  shaizei new my-demo-app
```

In order to generate a React-TypeScript app, named as `my-demo-app`, run the following command:

```shell
shaizei new my-demo-app --typescript
```

This will generate a new application for you in current directory.

## Configuration Options

Apps created with `@shaizei/cli` are built with sensible defaults yet very extensible at the core.

### shaizeirc.json

In order to configure certain behavior of development workflow, you can play with the options in `shaizeirc.json`. Here's how the file looks like in a newly scaffolded app:

```json
  {
    "typescript": false,
    "showErrorOverly": true,
    "emitLintingErrors": true,
    "host": "localhost",
    "defaultPort": 3000,
    "https": false,
    "addSourceMaps": false,
    "cssModules": true,
    "webpackDevSourceMap": "cheap-module-source-map",
    "webpackProdSourceMap": "source-map",
    "title": "Shaizei | JavaScript Starter"
  }
```

Please find the details of each property as follows:

- **typescript** (default: false)  
Set this flag to `true` if you want to support `.ts` or `.tsx` files.

- **showErrorOverly** (default: true)  
You'll see webpack error overlay for errors of various kinds to ease the development workflow. Turn this flag to `false` to get out of this default behavior.

- **emitLintingErrors** (default: false)  
By default, no linting error will break the development build, but if you want the `webpack-dev-server` to fail the build in case of any linting error, turn this flag to `true`.

- **host** (default: localhost)  
Modify this flag to change the default `localhost`.

- **defaultPort** (default: 3000)  
You can modify the default port by modifying this option. Note that if the mentioned port is already busy, dev server will be started on a different port.

- **https** (default: false)  
You can change this option to `true` in order to run the development server with HTTPS.

- **addSourceMaps** (default: true)  
By default, source maps for production bundle, (for CSS and JavaScript) will be generated. If you want to opt-out of this behavior, turn this flag to `false`.

- **cssModules** (default: false)  
By default, CSS Modules are not enabled, but you can enable by turning this flag to `true`.

- **webpackDevSourceMap** (default: 'cheap-module-source-map')
By default, `cheap-module-source-map` will be used as webpack-dev-server `devtool`. But you can add any other option, valid for webpack `devtool` option.

- **webpackProdSourceMap** (default: 'source-map')
By default, `source-map` will be used as a `devtool` for production bundle source maps. But you can add any other option, valid for webpack `devtool` option.

- **title** (default: 'React App | Shaizei')  
Change this option to change the document title.
